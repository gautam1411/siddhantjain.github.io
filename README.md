A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I have customized this for my needs. 

# Notes (mostly written for using this in the future)

* This a jekyll based site. So, to run this locally you will need jekyll. Look that up once, installed required things and then try running this site locally as is to get a hang of things.
* Major things to be configured are in config.yml. If you want to change the options on the top, use navigation.yml. If you want to change the front page, change pages/about.md
* For adding a new blog post, duplicate an existing blog post and then customise it. Everything else will happen automatically.
