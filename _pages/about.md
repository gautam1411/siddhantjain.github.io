I am currently pursuing an [MS in Computer Vision](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision-mscv/) from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to CMU I was working with Adobe Systems, India as a software developer on [Adobe Presenter Video Express](www.adobe.com/products/presenter-video-express.html)- building new video creation workflows using computer vision and image processing. 

I attended Birla Insitute of Technology and Science, Pilani as an undergraduate student where I double majored in Computer Science and Economics. I thoroughly enjoyed economics, but eventually decided to pursure a career as a computer scientist. For more details on my work, please refer to my [CV](siddhantjain.github.io/files/SiddhantJainResume.pdf).
