This project was made during a hackathon organised by Myntra - a fashion retailing website. Live-Ads spruces up print adveritisement by augmenting them with interactive 3D models that further add value to the content in the advertisement. Our demo was focused towards fashion retailers where we Augmented existing advertisements of Myntra with apparels advertised tried on computer generated 3D models. Our app, identified advertisements registers with it and added custom 3D models dynamically to the advertisement, along with call-to-action buttons to enable the consumer to buy the product directly.

Here is a demo video of the hack in action.
