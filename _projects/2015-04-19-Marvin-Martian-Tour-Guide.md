The Curiosity Rover has sent back terabytes of data so far. NASA has released stunning images received directly from Mars for public viewing. The project used these images to provide for a VR experience to the general public. We developed an app that can be used in conjunction with the openly available Google Cardboard to see 360 degrees views of Mars along with viewing Mars with a stereoscopic vision as if riding the rover itself.

The project was aimed to getting the masses involved with the ongoing research on Mars by providing them with an experience of being present on the Red Planet itself.

Marvin was adjudged as a winner for the Hackathon organised in Bangalore and was also a global nomination from the city.
