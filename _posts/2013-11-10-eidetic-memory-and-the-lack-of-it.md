<p>Eidetic Memory, more commonly known as photographic memory is basically the ability to remember everything you perceive through most of your senses. Â I just took a test <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/psychology/take-the-photographic-memory-test">here</a>, and well the predictable happened - I failed. Obviously, I do not have a photographic memory, hence this blog to archive things I want to recollect.
